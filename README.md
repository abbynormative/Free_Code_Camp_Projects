# Free_Code_Camp_Projects
Practice web development projects originally hosted at codepen: http://codepen.io/newbienewb/
- Calculator: self-explanatory. I wrote a calculator using Angular.js
- Camper News: Camper news was a news feed curated by Free Code Camp students. My project gave it a pretty UI with a search function (also coded with Angular). Unfortunately this API is no longer active.
- Wikipedia Viewer: This app pulls in a list of ten Wikipedia pages relating to your search term using the Wikipedia API.
- Markdown Previewer: My first app written in React with SCSS and Babel preprocessing. Allows you to preview your Github Markup. [View live at Codepen](http://codepen.io/newbienewb/full/PzdALN)
