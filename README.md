# Free_Code_Camp_Projects
Practice web development projects originally hosted at codepen: http://codepen.io/newbienewb/
- Calculator: self-explanatory. I wrote a calculator using Angular.js
- Camper News: Camper news is a news feed curated by Free Code Camp students. My project gives it a pretty UI with a search function (also coded with Angular).
